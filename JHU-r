distance or similarity
continuous: eucilidean distance ; correslation similarity.
binary: manhattan distance

#Dimension reduction
 And you see the idea is that we want to create a set of variables that is smaller 
 than the original set of variables that we have and that are all uncorrelated with each other.
 So that they kind of represent different types of variation in your data set. And similarly,
 we want this reduced set of variables to explain as much of the variability in your data set, as possible.
